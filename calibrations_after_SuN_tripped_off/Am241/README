Source was positioned at different locations along the beam pipe
in order to see the 60 keV gamma ray in the outer segments.

Make multiple directories for each run with a new source position in SuN. Copy create_histograms.C, fit_histograms.C, draw_fit_histograms.C and centroids.txt into each folder.

Run1028 source is between segments 2 and 3
Run1038 source is between segments 3 and 4
Run1039 source is centered on segment 4
Run1040 source is between segments 1 and 2
