How to use the gain_matching_SuN

1. Run gain_matching_hv scripts to get updated high voltage values for SuN on the website.
2. Edit pathway in create_histograms.C to your root file of interest.

   chains->Add("PATHWAY/TO/ROOT/FILES");

Run create_histograms.C in root.

    .x create_histograms.C

Close root.
3. Open root and run the fit_histograms.C.

   .x fit_histograms.C

Close root.
4. Open root and run draw_fit_histograms.C and check the fits. Sometimes it will not work and you need to fit some by hand.

   .x draw_fit_histograms.C

5. The new centroids will be output to centroids.txt. It adds on to the txt file so if it is run multiple times it will not overwrite the previous values.
