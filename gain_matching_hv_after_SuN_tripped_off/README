Directions to gain match SuN with high voltage.

1) Run get_current_high_voltages_from_website.sh to
   save the current MPOD voltage settings into
   current_high_voltages.txt   

2) Record a 20 minute background run

3) Convert that run into a SuN ROOT file

4) Copy that ROOT file into the fitting directory
   and name it hv_run.root

5) Run gain_match.sh. This will create the histograms
   and then fit the peak in each PMT that is from the
   1460.8 keV gamma ray from the decay of 40K to 40Ar
   that is present in room background radiation.
   The peaks are gain matched to the value of
   "new_channel_number" in the function "calculate_high_voltage"
   in the script fitting/fit_histograms.C.
   The new high voltage values are saved in new_high_voltages.txt.
   Check the fit results.

6) Check that the new high voltage values are reasonable.
   The fit results show the current and new high voltage
   on each pad associated with a PMT. Run draw_output_fit_histograms.C
   whenever you need to look at the fit results.

7) Run write_new_high_voltages_to_website.sh.
   This will set the new high voltage values on the
   MPOD power supply.
